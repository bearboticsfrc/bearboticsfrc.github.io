# Documentation Plan

## Goals

Finding information on how to do FRC programming sometimes feels like a wild goose chase.
Several different sources all offer their own information (and are sometimes conflicting or outdated).
This website should provide some way to make resources easier to find.

Implementing features such as automatic targeting or autonomous routines is also a process fraught with trial and error and much frustration.
This document should record how best to structure such things in code and provide a guide to the basic concepts (while directing readers to more comprehensive sources).

Finally, this website should evolve with the team, and remain dynamic as new technologies, resources, and strategies appear.
It is not intended to be the end-all source for *every* question or tutorialâ€”rather, it's for the times when someone says "I wish I would've found that earlier."

## Existing Resources

TODO

## Style Guides

TODO

## Outline of Topics

- Higher level documentation of existing and future robot code
- Lists of useful sources for various programming needs (e.g. computer vision, path following)
- Notes and tips on how best to manage an FRC programming team

## Tools & Deliverables

The site will be hosted on GitHub Pages, owned by the [Bearbotics Organization](https://github.com/bearboticsfrc/). Changes should be available through pull requests, and approved by administrators.
